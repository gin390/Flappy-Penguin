# Flappy-Penguin
A 2D game about a penguin trying to fly. Made using Processing. (NOTE: Not related to "Flappy Bird". But it was a cute name and I am unimaginative, so I took it.)

To play this game, go to:

https://processing.org/

and download Processing.

Then just double-click 'Project_3_v2Final.pde' and hit Run.

# Flappy-Penguin
A 2D vertical scroller game about a penguin trying to fly. Try not to fall!
Made using Processing. (NOTE: Not related to "Flappy Bird". But it was a cute name and I am unimaginative, so I took it ;).)

To play this game, go to:

https://processing.org/

and download Processing.
Then just double-click 'Project_3_v2Final.pde' and hit 'Run' at the top left.

(NOTE: DO NOT change the extracted folder name! Make sure all images, music, etc. are in a folder named 'Project_3_v2Final'.)
